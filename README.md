# Table Football Coding Challenge

The objective of this project is to develop a solution for a coding challenge that necessitates the creation of an application alongside a service that delivers a REST API.

## Resume
This project aims to resolve the issue of table football enthusiasts struggling to keep track of scores and determine the ultimate champion. By developing a simple application, users can monitor scores in real-time, store game results, and view comprehensive statistics.

## Technologies
- Flutter: Framework used for the development of the application.
- Laravel:  Backend framework used for developing the RESTful API.

## Required User Stories
- As a user, I want to start a new game between two teams so that I can keep track of score as the game is being played.

- As a user, I want to create a game that has already been played so that I can enter the result of that game.

- As a user, I want to be able to create teams with one or two players so that I can reuse the teams when I create new games.

- As a user, I want to see a dashboard with team and individual player statistics so that I can see who is the ultimate champion.
