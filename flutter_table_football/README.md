# Table Football Coding Challenge
This is the flutter app for a table football game.

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to start a new game between two teams so that I can keep track of score as the game is being played.

2. As a user, I want to create a game that has already been played so that I can enter the result of that game.

3. As a user, I want to be able to create teams with one or two players so that I can reuse the teams when I create new games.

4. As a user, I want to be able to identify my self on the app or delete my account 

5. As a user, I want to see a dashboard with team and individual player statistics so that I can see who is the ultimate champion.

### GoRouter
GoRouter is a package that allows us to navigate between screens in our app using URLs and route names, which simplifies navigation. I have also used it in other projects, and it meets all the requirements for this project.

### Immutable Models
The decision to use immutable models was made because it simplifies state management and makes it easier, among other reasons, such as widget rebuild optimization, for instance.
